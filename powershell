Ah, I see! You want a roadmap for learning **PowerShell** (not Zig) from basic to advanced. My mistake, but no worries, I'll give you a complete breakdown for **PowerShell** in the same "basic to god" style. 

### **PowerShell Roadmap: From Beginner to Expert**

PowerShell is a powerful automation tool and scripting language designed for Windows system administration and automation, but it's also cross-platform now (on Linux and macOS). The goal of this roadmap is to guide you through understanding PowerShell from the ground up and advance you to expert-level skills.

---

### **1. PowerShell Basics**

#### **1.1 Setting Up PowerShell**
- **Windows PowerShell** comes pre-installed on most Windows machines.
- **PowerShell Core (v7+)** is cross-platform and works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Install PowerShell from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

#### **1.2 Basic Commands**
- Start with basic **cmdlets** (PowerShell commands). Every PowerShell command is a **cmdlet** (pronounced "command-let").
  
```powershell
Get-Help      # View documentation for cmdlets
Get-Command   # List all available cmdlets
Get-Process   # Get all running processes
```

- **Cmdlet Syntax**: `Verb-Noun` (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Set-Item`).

#### **1.3 Variables & Data Types**
- PowerShell variables start with a `$` symbol. It uses loosely typed variables.
  
```powershell
$var = 10      # Integer variable
$name = "John" # String variable
$flag = $true  # Boolean variable
```

#### **1.4 Pipelining**
- PowerShell uses pipes (`|`) to pass the output of one cmdlet as input to another. Learn how to chain commands.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 100} # Get processes with CPU usage > 100
```

- **Filters and Where-Object**: Filtering results with `Where-Object` (e.g., filter processes based on CPU usage).

#### **1.5 Aliases**
- PowerShell has **aliases** for common cmdlets to shorten commands.

```powershell
ls      # Alias for Get-ChildItem
dir     # Alias for Get-ChildItem
ps      # Alias for Get-Process
```

---

### **2. Intermediate Concepts**

#### **2.1 Working with Files and Directories**
- **Cmdlets for File Operations**:
  
```powershell
Get-ChildItem        # Get a list of files and directories
New-Item             # Create a new file or directory
Remove-Item          # Delete files or directories
Copy-Item            # Copy files or directories
Move-Item            # Move files or directories
```

- **Navigating Filesystems**: Understand how to navigate between directories.

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users"  # Change the current directory
```

#### **2.2 Working with Objects**
- PowerShell returns objects, not just text. Learn how to work with **properties** and **methods** of objects.

```powershell
$process = Get-Process -Name "notepad"
$process.Name        # Access property of the object
$process | Format-Table Name, CPU # Format output as a table
```

- **Properties vs Methods**: Learn the difference and use `Get-Member` to explore an objectâ€™s members.

```powershell
$process | Get-Member  # View properties and methods of the object
```

#### **2.3 Conditionals and Loops**
- Use **if/else**, **switch**, and **ternary operators** to make decisions.

```powershell
if ($x -gt 10) { "Greater than 10" }
else { "Not greater than 10" }
```

- **Loops**: Learn `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do` loops.

```powershell
foreach ($item in $array) { Write-Host $item }
```

#### **2.4 Functions**
- Create reusable code blocks with functions.
  
```powershell
function Get-Square {
    param ($number)
    return $number * $number
}

Get-Square 5  # Output: 25
```

- **Parameters**: Learn how to accept parameters in your functions.
  
```powershell
function Greet {
    param ($name)
    "Hello, $name!"
}
Greet "Alice"  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### **2.5 Working with Arrays and HashTables**
- **Arrays**: Collections of items.

```powershell
$array = @(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
$array[0]  # Access array element
```

- **HashTables**: Key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in other languages.

```powershell
$hashtable = @{"Key1" = "Value1"; "Key2" = "Value2"}
$hashtable["Key1"]  # Access value by key
```

---

### **3. Advanced PowerShell Concepts**

#### **3.1 Advanced Functions and Cmdlet Design**
- **Advanced Function Parameters**: Use advanced parameters like **switches**, **validation**, and **default values**.

```powershell
function Get-Info {
    param (
        [string]$Name,
        [switch]$Verbose
    )
    if ($Verbose) { Write-Host "Getting info for $Name" }
    return "Info about $Name"
}
```

- **CmdletBinding**: Make functions behave like cmdlets with attributes.

```powershell
[CmdletBinding()]
function Get-Details {
    param (
        [string]$Name
    )
    Write-Host "Getting details for $Name"
}
```

#### **3.2 Working with REST APIs and Web Requests**
- Learn how to interact with web services, call REST APIs, and handle JSON.

```powershell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com"
$response.name  # Access a field in the JSON response
```

#### **3.3 Modules and Packaging**
- **Creating and Importing Modules**: Modularize your scripts by creating reusable modules.

```powershell
# Save your functions in a .psm1 file and import them
Import-Module "MyModule.psm1"
```

- **Creating Modules**: Learn how to package and distribute reusable scripts.

```powershell
New-Module -Name MyModule -ScriptBlock { Write-Host "Hello from MyModule" }
```

#### **3.4 Error Handling**
- **Try/Catch/Finally**: Handle errors gracefully and debug your scripts.

```powershell
try {
    Get-Content "nonexistentfile.txt"
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error occurred: $_"
} finally {
    Write-Host "This will always run"
}
```

- **Throwing Errors**: Throw custom errors in your scripts.

```powershell
throw "Something went wrong!"
```

### **4. Expert PowerShell Skills**

#### **4.1 Scripting Best Practices**
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement structured error handling with logs and verbose output.

```powershell
$logFile = "C:\logs\script.log"
Write-Output "Started script" | Out-File $logFile -Append
```

- **Debugging**: Use built-in tools for debugging scripts.

```powershell
Set-PSDebug -Trace 1  # Trace script execution
```

#### **4.2 PowerShell Remoting**
- **Invoke-Command**: Execute commands on remote computers.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
```

- **Session-based Remoting**: Use `Enter-PSSession` and `Exit-PSSession` for interactive remote sessions.

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01"
Get-Process
Exit-PSSession
```

#### **4.3 Desired State Configuration (DSC)**
- Learn **DSC** to manage configuration as code.

```powershell
Configuration MyServerConfig {
    Node "Server01" {
        WindowsFeature "Web-Server" { Ensure = "Present" }
    }
}
MyServerConfig
```

- **Automation and Orchestration**: Automate infrastructure management with DSC, scheduled tasks, or Azure Automation.

#### **4.4 PowerShell Core and Cross-Platform Scripting**
- Learn how to write cross-platform scripts with **PowerShell Core (v7+)** for **Linux/macOS/Windows**.

```powershell
# Write a script that works on all platforms
$os = Get-OS
Write-Host "Running on $os"
```

#### **4.5 Advanced Module Development**
- Learn how to develop your own **cmdlets** using **C#** and **Powershell SDK**. This is for creating high-performance cmdlets and modules.

#### **4.6 Integrating PowerShell with Other Tools**
- **Azure PowerShell**: Automate and manage **Azure** resources using PowerShell.
  
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
