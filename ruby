If you're looking to master Ruby—from beginner basics to expert-level knowledge of the **entire Ruby ecosystem**, you've come to the right place! Ruby is a beautifully simple language that’s beloved by developers for its clean, elegant syntax and its powerful ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, particularly in web development (like **Ruby on Rails**). 

Here’s a **comprehensive guide** to take you from Ruby newbie to "god-level" expert, covering **core language features**, **advanced concepts**, and **Ruby's ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks**.

---

### **1. Ruby Basics (Beginner Level)**

  - Constants and variable naming conventions.
- **Basic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`, etc.
- **String Interpolation**: `puts "Hello, #{name}!"`
- **Basic Input/Output**: 
  - Reading input: `gets`, `gets.chomp`
  - Outputting: `puts`, `print`, `p`.

#### **1.2 Control Flow**
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elsif`, `else`, `unless`.
- **Loops**: `while`, `until`, `for`, `each`.

#### **1.3 Collections**
- **Arrays**: Basic array operations: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `each`, `map`, `select`.
- **Hashes**: Key-value pairs, iterating over keys and values, adding/removing elements.
- **Symbols**: Lightweight alternatives to strings (e.g., `:name` vs `"name"`).
- **Ranges**: Using `..` and `...` for inclusive and exclusive ranges.

#### **1.4 Methods and Blocks**
- **Defining Methods**: `def method_name` and method arguments.
- **Blocks**: Understanding Ruby blocks, using `yield`, passing blocks to methods.
- **Procs and Lambdas**: Differences and use cases of `Proc.new`, `lambda`, and `->`.
  
#### **1.5 Error Handling**
- **Exceptions**: `begin`, `rescue`, `else`, `ensure`, `raise`.
- **Standard Errors**: `StandardError`, `ArgumentError`, `RuntimeError`, etc.

### **2. Intermediate Ruby (Level Up)**

Once you’ve mastered the basics, dive deeper into Ruby’s **object-oriented programming** (OOP) features and start working with more powerful Ruby tools.

#### **2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby**
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, creating instances, and using instance variables.
- **Methods in Classes**: Getter (`attr_reader`), setter (`attr_writer`), and accessor (`attr_accessor`).
- **Inheritance**: Using `class Child < Parent` for subclassing and `super` to call parent methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods in child classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Using `private`, `protected`, and `public` visibility.
- **Modules and Mixins**: Using `include` to mix modules into classes and `extend` to add methods as class methods.
- **Class Methods**: Defining methods on the class itself using `self`.

#### **2.2 Advanced Data Structures**
- **Collections**:
  - **Arrays**: Advanced array manipulations using `each_with_index`, `group_by`, `sort_by`.
  - **Hashes**: Using `each`, `each_key`, `each_value`, `select`, `merge`, `reject`.
  - **Sets**: Using the `Set` class for collections without duplicates (`require 'set'`).
- **Structs**: Creating simple data structures with `Struct.new`.

#### **2.3 Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas**
- **Blocks**: How blocks work and when to use them effectively with methods.
- **Procs**: Creating reusable blocks using `Proc.new` or `proc`.
- **Lambdas**: Differences between `Proc` and `lambda` (argument handling, return behavior).

#### **2.4 File I/O**
- **Reading and Writing Files**: Using `File.open`, `File.read`, `File.write`.
- **File Paths**: Understanding absolute vs relative paths.
- **Directories**: Working with directories, `Dir.foreach`, `Dir.glob`.

#### **2.5 Testing in Ruby**
- **Unit Testing with `minitest`**: Writing test cases using `assert_equal`, `assert_nil`, `assert_raises`.
- **RSpec**: Understanding behavior-driven development (BDD) with RSpec for writing readable, maintainable tests.

### **3. Advanced Ruby (Mastery)**

Now that you’re comfortable with Ruby’s core features, dive deeper into advanced topics like metaprogramming, concurrency, and performance.

#### **3.1 Metaprogramming**
- **Dynamic Methods**: Defining methods at runtime with `define_method`.
- **Method Missing**: Using `method_missing` to handle dynamic method calls.
- **Class Macros**: Using `class_eval` and `instance_eval` for modifying classes and objects dynamically.
- **Reflection**: Using `respond_to?`, `send`, `instance_variable_get`, `instance_variable_set`.
  
#### **3.2 Concurrency and Parallelism**
- **Threads**: Creating and managing threads using `Thread.new`, `Thread.join`.
- **Mutex**: Synchronizing threads with `Mutex` to prevent race conditions.
- **Fiber**: Using `Fiber` for lightweight concurrency.
- **Concurrent Ruby Gem**: A higher-level approach for concurrency, including `Concurrent::Future`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

#### **3.3 Performance Optimization**
- **Profiling Code**: Using tools like `Benchmark`, `ruby-prof`, or `stackprof` to profile performance.
- **Garbage Collection**: Understanding Ruby's garbage collection (GC) and how to optimize memory usage.
- **Lazy Enumerables**: Using lazy enumerables (`lazy`) for memory-efficient data processing.

#### **3.4 Ruby Internals**
- **Ruby's Memory Model**: Understanding the Ruby interpreter, garbage collection, and how Ruby handles objects in memory.
- **Understanding the Ruby VM**: Diving into how Ruby's Virtual Machine (MRI) works, including understanding bytecode and JIT compilation.
